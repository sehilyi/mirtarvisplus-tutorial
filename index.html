<h2>miRTarVis+</h2>

<p>miRTarVis+ is a web-based interactive visual analytics tool for microRNA target predictions.</p>

<p>In this document, I will introduce you how to use miRTarVis+ step by step.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Recommended using the latest version of Chrome and Safari</li>
	<li>Currently, it is NOT TESTED for Internet Explorer</li>
	<li>Minimum screen resolution: 960 x 720 px</li>
</ul>

<h3>Access to miRTarVis+</h3>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://sehilyi.com/mirtarvisplus/">Link to miRTarVis+</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://hcil.snu.ac.kr/research/mirtarvisplus">Research page of miRTarVis+</a> @ SNU-HCIL</li>
</ul>

<h3>Main interface of miRTarVis+: step-by-step navigation</h3>

<figure><img src="figures/Figure1.png"/></figure>

<p>miRTarVis+ uses a step-by-step navigation interface. The main menu consists of four submenus, including <em>load data</em>, <em>filter</em>, <em>prediction</em>, and <em>visualization</em>.</p>

<h3>Simple tutorial with sample data</h3>

<p>Here, I will show you how to use miRTarVis+ with a randomly generated sample miRNA-mRNA expression profile data.</p>

<h4>Input data</h4>

<p>From the <a href="http://hcil.snu.ac.kr/research/mirtarvisplus">research page of miRTarVis+</a>, you can download example data of miRNA and mRNA expression profile data. </p>

<p>They are CSV format file, whose first row contains sample names and their first column contains miRBase miRNA ID for miRNA or gene symbols for mRNA. These two files contain expression level for multiple samples all miRNAs or mRNAs. And for each miRNA or mRNA-sample, they measured twice (treatment vs. control). All values in the example data were randomly generated in the range of 0 ~ 1000.</p>

<h4>Load data</h4>

<p>In the load menu, you can see five types of input data on the left side. Select &quot;Paired Two-sample&quot; (which is selected by default), and choose two files, one for a miRNA expression file and the other for a mRNA expression file. (Please do not confuse with the order of the two files :D) Select the Load Data button on the below to start loading data. You can see loading progress. Be patient, when loading large data. </p>

<p>After loading these two data, miRTarVis+ calculates p-value and fold change right after the data load. Also, it shows distributions of p-value and fold change with histograms. The image on the below shows how miRTarVis+ looks like when loading is finished.</p>

<h4>Filter</h4>

<p>Let&#39;s go to the next step. We want to search for differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs. As we have p-value for each miRNA or mRNA, it seems a good idea to use p-value to identify differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs. Let&#39;s click Filter menu in the navigation. Then, it will show the filtering interface. Letâ€™s filter the data by p-value as the value of 0.05 for both miRNA and mRNA.</p>

<figure><img src="figures/Figure.t.3.png"/></figure>

<h4>Predict</h4>

<p>The next step is prediction. miRTarVis+ searches for possible miRNA-target pairs for the filtered data. miRTarVis+ supports two sequence-based prediction algorithms (TargetScan and microRNA.org) and four expression profile-based prediction algorithms (correlation analysis, mutual information, GenMiR++, and MINE analysis). </p>

<p>For now, let&#39;s use the simplest one, the correlation analysis. It searches for miRNA-mRNA pairs which have high correlation coefficients. See this image first.</p>

<figure><img src="figures/Figure5.png"/></figure>

<p>These are results of target prediction by correlation analysis. Let&#39;s see parameters of prediction algorithms.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Top N Interactions</em>: Maximum number of resulting miRNA-mRNA pairs in terms of prediction values. As we set 100 to this parameter, miRTarVis+ gave us top 100 miRNA-mRNA pairs who scored high correlation coefficient.</li>
	<li><em>Start with</em>: Search miRNA-mRNA pairs that is also predicted by a certain sequence-based prediction algorithm (i.e., TargetScan or microRNA.org). Starting expression profile based prediction from sequence-based prediction improves biological significance of prediction result.</li>
	<li><em>Cutoff</em>: Remain only miRNA-mRNA pairs whose absolute value of correlation coefficient is above this value.</li>
	<li><em>Correlation Type</em>: Select between Pearson or Spearman coefficients</li>
	<li><em>Negative Correlation</em>: Remain pairs whose correlation coefficient are negative.</li>
	<li><em>Change Direction</em>: We can filter miRNA-mRNA pairs by their fold change direction. Using this parameter, we can expect better prediction results.</li>
</ul>

<p>After adjusting parameters, press Start button, then, miRTarVis+ will show the results in a table after finishing calculation.</p>

<h4>Visualization</h4>

<p>Now, we have miRNA-mRNA pairs which are predicted by algorithms! miRTarVis+ visualizes the miRNA-mRNA network to help you understand the miRNA-mRNA network structure. Traditionally, this kind of network is visualized using a node-link diagram, and miRTarVis+ also supports a node-link diagram. </p>

<figure><img src="figures/Figure3.png"/></figure>

<p>You can select a node and highlight its neighbors, or you can move a node by dragging. If you click on a miRNA and shift-click on another miRNA, then miRTarVIs+ will highlight all their common targets. miRTarVis supports zoom in/out using simple mouse wheel and drag interactions. Please try this yourselves!</p>

<p>In addition, miRTarVis shows the network in an interactive treemap visualization. See the following image.</p>

<figure><img src="figures/Figure4.png"/></figure>

<p>This visualization shows the same network that node-link diagrams did. This two-level treemap shows miRNAs as first level nodes and their targets as their child nodes. </p>

<p>If multiple miRNAs target the same miRNA, then it is hard to catch such situation in the treemap visualization. To overcome this limitation, miRTarVis+ gives a clue to see such relationships. If you hover mouse pointer over an mRNA node, then the treemap will only highlight that mRNA and its parent nodes.</p>

<p>In both visualizations, color represents fold change values of miRNAs and mRNAs.</p>

<p>There were other functions such as link to external databases in both the visualizations. You can do this by right-click on a node in node-link diagram or treemap visualizations. I want to end this tutorial with one of these functions: Term Enrichment analysis in Gene Ontology web service. If prediction result is biologically meaningful, we can expect that predicted targets of a miRNA has common biological function. To help verifying that, miRTarVis+ provide a link to Term Enrichment analysis from Gene Ontology web service.</p>

<figure><img src="figures/Figure.t.4.png"/></figure>

<p>If you click the &quot;Enrichment analysis connected genes in GO&quot; in a context menu,</p>

<figure><img src="figures/Figure.t.5.png"/></figure>

<p>a dialog will appears like this. It shows all predicted targets of miRNA (hsa-mir-106a for here). After setting species and ontology as you want, let&#39;s click &#39;Open GO Web Service&#39; button in the dialog. Then, enrichment analysis result will appear in your default browser. Sometimes the network request times out when there are many target mRNAs, so no results will appear after long time. In such circumstances, please try it again later.</p>

<p>This is the end of the miRTarVis+ tutorial. I wish I can update this document in near future :-)</p>

<p>If you have any question, or find some bugs while using miRTarVis+, please feel free to contact me (email: shlyi@hcil.snu.ac.kr).</p>
